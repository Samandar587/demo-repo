Lorem, Lorem, Lorem
Lorem, Lorem, Lorem
Far from the place,where i am writing this song,
There is a girl to whom my heart belongs.

Lorem, Lorem, Lorem
Lorem, Lorem, Lorem
Far from the place,where i am writing this song,
There is a girl to whom my heart belongs.

I found a love, for me
Darling, just dive right in and follow my lead
Well, I found a girl, beautiful and sweet
Oh, I never knew you were the someone waiting for me
